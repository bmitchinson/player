my job restricts me from running vlc or cog ....

static site web app @ player.mitchinson.dev:
- plays back music from the local filesystem.
    - there are no file uploads.
    - browser apis are used to load individual files.
- shows album art
- progress bar
-
- cozy vibe inspired by games since a lot of daytime music is ambient OST tracks

I'm realizing that leerob vercel music app has a lot of this already

whatever i wanna make my own, i'll steal some of those feature requirements tho:

- Uses MediaSession API to sync track metadata with system controls
-


vibe code generated, after this template init:
